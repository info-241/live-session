# Apples to Apples

## Learning Objectives 

At the conclusion of this week's live session, student will be able to:

1. *Describe*, using the technical language of potential outcomes, what it means for an input to *cause* an output. 
2. *Describe* the fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. *Apply* iid sampling as a method of producing an unbiased, consistent estimator of a population. 
4. *Proove* that the average treatment effect estimator produces an unbaised, consistent estimator for the average treatment effect. 

## This Causes That

What does it mean for an action to cause an outcome? Don't worry about conducting the experiment, or any measurement concerns at this point, just engage with the concepts. 

### Damn fine coffee

Suppose that you're getting ready for class, and you want to make sure that you're at your best. So, you drink a cup of water, eat a small snack, and brew a small pot of coffee for while you're in class. 

> Why do you do this? 

Presumably, you're doing this because you like each of these things, but also because you're interested in these things causing you to have a better class. If you framed this as as causal question, you might ask: 

> If I drink a cup of coffee before class, will it cause me to be more alert? 

What does it mean for coffee to cause alertness? 

- Does coffee cause everyone to become more alert? 
- Does coffee have to affect everyone equally in order for you to say it causes alertness? 
- Could coffee have no effect for some people, and you would still say it causes alertness? 
  
### Meditation for focus 

Suppose that you're getting ready for class, and you want ensure that you're at your best. So, you find a quiet place, and set your mind at ease with whatever form of meditation you think might be helpful. 

> If I meditate before class, will it cause me to be more focused? 

What does it mean for meditation to cause focus? 

- Does meditation cause everyone to become more focused? 
- Does meditation have to affect everyone equally? 
- Some people are frustrated by not being able to quiet their thoughts, and actually find meditation frustrating. Can this be true, and still believe that meditation causes focus? 

### Selling coffee and meditation

Suppose that you're an enterprising soul, and you want to sell a book about brewing coffee as a meditation. You reason that there must be a niche for this approach. To get the word out, you place a few flyers with tear off phone-numbers at the local yoga studios and tech incubators (good intuition to find those MIDS students). 

> If shown a flyer for coffee-meditatin, will it cause someone to take my training? 

What does it mean for for flyers to cause people to sign-up for the training?

- Does the flyer cause everyone to take the training? 
- Does the flyer affect everyone equally? 

### Reflecting on Causes

Does anything unify questions of causes? 

When you think about *{this}* causing *{that}*, do you think about it at a population level, a smaller group level, or at the individual level? 

## Potential Outcomes

Potential outcomes are a system of reasoning, and a corresponding notation, that allow us to talk about observable and un-observable characteristics of the world. 

> What is your position on *ontology*? What does it mean for something to exist? 

- Does *Field Experiments*, as a textbook, exist? 
- Do Don Green and Alan Gerber, the authors of the textbook that we're reading, exist? 
- Does David Reiley, the slower-talking Davids in the async, exist? 
- Do I, your section, instructor, exist (or am I a deep fake in this room with you)?
- Can a concept exist, even if you can't hold it? Even if you haven't seen it? 

### Defining Potential Outcomes 

For each of the following sets of notation: (1) Read the notation aloud, not as "Y sub i zero", but instead as "The potential outcome to control ...". 

- $Y_{i}(0)$: 
- $Y_{i}(1)$:  
- $E[Y_{i}(0)]$: 
- $E[Y_{i}(1)]$: 
- $E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0]$:
- $E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i}=1]$:
- $E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=1]$:
- $E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i}=0]$:

- Which of these concepts that you have just read aloud exist? 
- Can a concept exist, even if you can't hold it? Even if you can't see it? 

## Using Independence 

Suppose that you have a random variable that is defined as the function, 

$$
Y = 
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{10} & ,0 \leq y \leq 10 \\ 
    0 & \text{, otherwise}
  \end{cases}
$$

- What is the expected value of this function? 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  E[Y]  &= \int_{0}^{10} y \cdot f_{y}(y) \ dy                       \\ 
        &= \int_{0}^{10} y \cdot \frac{1}{10} \ dy                   \\ 
        &= \frac{1}{10}\int_{0}^{10} y \ dy                          \\ 
        &= \left.\frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{1}{2}  y^2\right|_{0}^{10} \\ 
        &= \left.\frac{1}{20}  y^{2} \right|_{0}^{10}                \\ 
        &= \frac{1}{20} \cdot \left[(100) - (0) \right]              \\ 
        &= \frac{1}{20} \cdot 100                                    \\
        &= \mathbf{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Why is the expected value a good characterization of a random variable?

- If you wanted to write down an estimator to produce a summary statistic for $Y$ given a sample of data, what properties do the following estimators possess: 

- $\hat{\theta}_{1} = y_{1}$
- $\hat{\theta}_{2} = \frac{1}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{2} y_{i}$
- $\hat{\theta}_{3} = \frac{1}{n-1} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}$
- $\hat{\theta}_{4} = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}$

```{r make population function} 
population_function <- function(sample_size) { 
  runif(n=sample_size, min=0, max=10)
}
```

```{r write estimators}
theta_1 <- function(data) { 
  # take the first element
  
}

theta_2 <- function(data) { 
  # sum the first two elements and divide by two
  
}

theta_3 <- function(data) { 
  # sum the sample, and divide by 1 less than the sample size
  
}

theta_4 <- function(data) { 
  # sum the sample, and divide by the sample size 
  # honestly, just use the mean call. 
  # clearly, this is a silly function to write, since you're just 
  # providing an alias, without modification, to an existing function. 
  
}

theta_4 <- function(data) { 
  mean(data)
  } 
```

```{r}
theta_4(population_function(100))
```
