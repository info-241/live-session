Alex Hughes, Micah Gell-Redman, Scott Guenther, &amp; David Wheeler 2021-11-17 1 Live Session Introduction This is the live session work space for the course. Our goal with this repository, is that we’re able to communicate ahead of time our aims for each week, and that you can prepare accordingly. 1.1 Bloom’s Taxonomy An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one level of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning. In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session. Remember A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts. Understand A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept is, or why the concept works in the way that it does. Apply A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem. Analyze A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be. Evaluate A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals. Create A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.

What is the value of making a causal statement? This is a data science program, with enough data and a savvy enough model, can’t we just generate a causal statement that will be right? Can’t I generate a statement that converges in probability to the correct value? 2.1 Learning Objectives At the end of this live session, students will be able to Remember (or find) the goals of the course, the assessment structure, and the learning model. Define, in non-technical language, what it means for an action to cause an outcome. Understand the difference between a causal statement, and an association statement. Apply the framework of causal thinking against a series of studies to determine whether the study has achieved the goal that it intends. 2.2 Class Introductions In no more than 2 minutes, could each student please: Introduce themselves, announcing their name as they would like it to be pronounced; Tell us where in the world they are studying; State what semester they are in the program; Any descriptive features that they would like the class to know about them (for example, gender pronouns); and, [Instructor’s choice] 2.3 Course Plan The course is built out into three distinct phases Part 1 Develops causal theory, potential outcomes, and a permutation-based uncertainty measurement Part 2 Further develops the idea of a treatment effect, and teaches how the careful design of experiments can improve the efficiency, and easy of analysis Part 3 Presents practical considerations when conducting an experiment, including problems that may arise, and how to design an experiment in anticipation of those problems. 2.4 Course Logistics bCourses Learning Modules attached to weeks Modules contain async lectures, coding exercises, and quizzes GitHub All the course materials are available in a GitHub repository We have protected the main branch, so you can’t do anything destructive Use that as empowerment! This is your class, propose changes that you would like to see! Github Classroom Assignments will all be applied programming assignments against simulated and real data All assignment code will be distributed through GitHub Classroom Gradescope All assignments will be submitted to Gradescope where we’ll read your solutions and provide scores and feedback 2.4.1 Learning model for the class The course assignments are designed to put what we have learned in reading, async, and live session into practice in code. In our ideal version of your studying, we would have you working hard together with your classmates in a study group on the assignments, coming to office hours to talk candidly about what is and isn’t working, and then every single student arriving at a full solution. 2.4.2 Feedback model for the class We want to get you feedback very quickly after you turn your assignments. We will release a solution set the day that you turn your assignment in We will hold a problem set debrief office hour the Friday (i.e. next day) after the problem set it submitted We will have light-feedback on your assignments within 7 days of when you submitted them. You should bring your assignment to office hours after you have turned it in so that we can talk about any differences between your approach, and the instructors approach. 2.4.3 Office hour model for the class We will hold office hours Sunday through Thursday at 5:30. We will hold more than 10 hours of office hours every week; they will all be recorded, and any student is welcome in any office hour 2.5 Article Discussion 2.5.1 Predict or Cause What are a few examples that Athey raises of causal questions masquerading as prediction questions? Which of these examples is the most surprising to you? Is there something that is common to each of these examples? Is this a general phenomenon, or is Athey very clever in picking examples? Said differently, is Athey making a clever argument or is a lot of what we do as data scientists actually causal work in disguise? 2.5.2 Do the suburbs make you fat? What is the causal claim being made in this article? If you had to draw out this causal claim, using arrows, what would it look like? Do you acknowledge the association that the authors present? Is there actually a difference between the BMI of people who live in cities and the suburbs? If you acknowledge the association, does that compel you to believe the causal claim? Why or why not? Name, and draw, five alternative confounding variables that might make you skeptical that the claimed relationship exists. (Optional) Name, and draw two mechanisms that might exist between suburbs and BMI. Why does the existence (or not) of these mechanisms not pose a fundamental problem to the causal claim that the authors make? At the conclusion of reading this paper, do you believe that there is a causal relationship between location and BMI? If so, what compels you to to believe this; if not, why are you not compelled to believe this? 2.5.3 Nike Shoes What is the causal claim being made in this article? If you had to draw out this causal claim, using arrows, what would it look like? Do you acknowledge the association that the authors present? Is there actually a difference in the finish time between people who are running with the Nike shoes vs. other shoes? If you acknowledge the association, does that compel you to believe the causal claim? Why or why not? What are some of the confounding relationships that the authors identify? How do they adjust their analyses once they acknowledge the confounding problem? At the conclusion of reading this paper, do you believe that there is a causal relationship between shoes and finish time? If so, what compels you to to believe this; if not, why are you not compelled to believe this? 2.5.4 What is Science: Feynman’s View In Cargo Cult Science, Richard Feynman poses a view of science that is about a seeking of the truth. What is Feynman’s view of science? What does he think makes something scientific? What are ways that individuals fool themselves when they are working as scientists? What are ways that individuals fool themselves when they are working as data scientists? How can we as (data) scientists, train ourselves not to be fooled?
