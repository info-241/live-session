"],["blooms-taxonomy.html", "Bloom’s Taxonomy", " Bloom’s Taxonomy An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one level of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning. In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session. Remember A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts. Understand A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept is, or why the concept works in the way that it does. Apply A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem. Analyze A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be. Evaluate A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals. Create A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.

So, you drink a cup of water, eat a small snack, and brew a small pot of coffee for while you’re in class. Why do you do this? Presumably, you’re doing this because you like each of these things, but also because you’re interested in these things causing you to have a better class. If you framed this as as causal question, you might ask: If I drink a cup of coffee before class, will it cause me to be more alert? What does it mean for coffee to cause alertness? Does coffee cause everyone to become more alert? Does coffee have to affect everyone equally in order for you to say it causes alertness? Could coffee have no effect for some people, and you would still say it causes alertness? 2.2.2 Meditation for focus Suppose that you’re getting ready for class, and you want ensure that you’re at your best.

Can this be true, and still believe that meditation causes focus? 2.2.3 Selling coffee and meditation Suppose that you’re an enterprising soul, and you want to sell a book about brewing coffee as a meditation. You reason that there must be a niche for this approach. To get the word out, you place a few flyers with tear off phone-numbers at the local yoga studios and tech incubators (good intuition to find those MIDS students). If shown a flyer for coffee-meditatin, will it cause someone to take my training? What does it mean for for flyers to cause people to sign-up for the training? Does the flyer cause everyone to take the training? Does the flyer affect everyone equally? 2.2.4 Reflecting on Causes Does anything unify questions of causes?

In this week, we present a different inferential paradigm, Randomization Inference.

You reason that drinking coffee will increase students’ alertness in class. “Damn Fine Coffee.” One might be a radical behaviorist (Skinner is perhaps the most famous in this line of thinking) that says, “In matters of human behavior, if I cannot see it, then I cannot reason or know about.” If this is your view, then you would simply stop your investigation (and reasoning) at the conclusion of your experiment. In many ways, experiments suited only to answer empirical, observable questions. These are the questions, and lens proposed by the radical behaviorist paradigm. 3.2.1 Limits of Behaviorist Reasoning If you accept only that coffee has this effect, and that it is measurable, are you able to translate this knowledge to a new context? Suppose that your experiments finds an effect of coffee on alertness: those who drink a cup of coffee are more alert in class. Suppose, though, that you’re out of coffee tonight. A radical behaviorist would simply say, “I know not what to drink then to increase my alertness.” 3.2.2 Value of Theory Can you produce several theories (some of them might be silly) about why coffee might increase alertness in class? Proposed theory #1: Proposed theory #2: Proposed theory #3: Does Feynman’s approach to Science provide a method to adjudicate which of these theories is consonant with the evidence, and which are not consonant with the evidence? - Does Lakatos’ approach to Science provide such a method? 3.2.3 Evaluating Theories What data might you be able to produce that would allow you to “drive a wedge” between the different theories?

"],["randomization-inference.html", "3.4 Randomization Inference", " 3.4 Randomization Inference 3.4.1 Stating the process of Randomization Inference Randomization inference is a method of understanding the variability of results in an experiment that you have conducted. It specifically acknowledges several facts: The sample of data that you collected or used in your experiment is, quite simply, the sample of data that you collected for your experiment. There might be a larger population; there might be an infinite population; or, there might not. The observed outcomes that you observe are, quite simply, the outcomes that you observed. There is no uncertainty about having seen these. When the experiment assigned some units to treatment and others to the control, it revealed some outcomes, for some people. Specifically, it revealed the potential outcoems to treatment, denoted \\(Y_{i}(1)\\) for those who were assigned to the treatment group and the potential outcomes to control, denoted \\(Y_{i}(0)\\) for those who were assigned to the control group. The experimenter chose one out of many possible treatment assignments. If the sharp null hypothesis were to be true (note the subjunctive verb tense there) then, the particular revelation of potential outcomes to treatment and control are inconsequential. Despite seeing only half the data (referred to as the Fundimental Problem of Causal Inference) we actually posess all the data. After all, if the sharp null were true, \\(Y_{Alex}(1) = Y_{Alex}(0)\\), and \\(Y_{David}(1) = Y_{David}(0)\\), \\(Y_{i}(1) = Y_{i}(0)\\) for all of the \\(i = {1, \\dots, N}\\) people who are a part of the experiment. 3.4.2 Questions about Randomization Inference Where does uncertainty come from in an experiment that is evaluated using randomization inference? How is the ATE estimand defined? What is the feasible method that we use to write down an estimator (call it \\(\\theta\\)) for this quantity? Which of the following properties does this feasible method possess? Unbiasedness: \\(E[\\theta] = ATE\\) Convergence: \\(\\theta \\overset{p}\\rightarrow ATE\\), where \\(\\overset{p}\\rightarrow\\) means converges in probabilty Efficiency: The mean squared error of \\(\\theta\\) is either (i) smaller than some other estimator, or (ii) as small is theoretically possible.

The data is defined in the following way, \\(D\\) is an indicator for whether the potential donor is assigned to treatment or control, and \\(Y\\) is the outcome of how much the potential donor actually gave. Let us provide a little bit more back story, that is necessary for the example to work, fully. Suppose that a progressive political candidate was hosting a fundraiser in Berkeley and has to make a choice about what to serve the attendees at the fundraiser. In the \\(D = 0\\) group, suppose that the candidate elects to serve a hippie-vegetarian staple, tofu sauteed in Bragg’s liquid aminos. (It is Berkeley after all.)

Talk about what, if anything, is notable about it, and what components of the data might be leading to any patterns that you note. How many of the randomization inference loops are larger than the treatment effect that you calculated? How would you use this statement to construct a one-sided test, and an associated p-value? How many of the randomization inference loops are more extreme (:metal:) than the treatment effect that you calculated? How would you use this statement to construct a two-sided test, and an associated p-value? Compare the two-sided p-value against the p-value that you generate from a two-tailed t-test. If these p-values are the same, would this be a positive or a negative characteristic of randomization inference? If these p-values are different, why would they be different? Don’t go looking all over hill-and-dale for the call for a t-test, it is at t.test. Which of the two of these inferrential methods do you prefer, randomization inference or a t-test, and why?
