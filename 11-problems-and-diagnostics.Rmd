## Learning Objectives 

At the conclusion of this week's live session, students will be able to: 

1. **Recall** and enumerate the several types of problems that might arise in the process of conducting a *real-world* experiment. 
2. **Identify** and **diagnose** when these problems are present in *their* experiment. 
3. **Analyze** the consequences of these problems, and communicate to an audience how these problems affect the experiment's ability to produce an unbiased causal estimator.
4. **Propose** a way forward -- how to modify the experiment or modify the estimator. 

## Goals of an Expermient 

Recall that the goal of any experiment -- same as the goal for *your* experiment -- is to identify a causal effect that we have a **guarantee** is unbiased. If we cannot accomplish that, why take the time to conduct the experiment? 

Conducting these experiments is **easy**! At least in a perfect world. The reality is that this world that we live in, and that your data generating process functions within, is far from "perfect". And so, as a consequence, machines that we tell to record data fail; people that we tell to take treatment don't actually take it; doses that we think will be sufficient are not; and a litany of other small concerns! 

This week's task is to acknowledge that nothing will *ever* be perfect, and then to proactively design our data collection system so that we can diagnose problems when they arise. 

## Problems with Randomization 

Suppose that you are going to conduct an experiment that evaluates the effectiveness of encouragements to complete homework and you have designed the operational details in the following way: 

1. You have randomized the list of currently enrolled MIDS 241 students into three treatment groups. Group A will receive **Always Encouragement**, their instructor will Slack them every day and remind them that Problem Set 4 is coming due; Group B will receive **Baseline Encouragement**, where they will receive the normal communication from the class; Group C will receive **Conditional Encouragement**, where students will only be contacted if their grades are below the class average. 
2. Although you've designed the experiment, contact for students will require that the individual classroom instructors take action to send the encouragements.

1. **How could this randomization break?** In this breakout, list as many specific ways that you think that the list of people who are assigned to Group A, B, and C might not match those who actually are in the groups. How many ways can you imagine? 
2. **What are the consequences?** After listing all the ways that the randomization *could* breakdown, what are the three ways that you think would be more damaging to generating an unbiased causal estimate? 
3. **How would you detect?** For these three problems that you've identified, how would you know if the randomization has broken down in this particular way?
