## Learning Objectives

1. *Define*, in non-technical language, what it means for an action to cause an outcome. 
2. *Understand* the difference between a causal statement, and an association statement. 
3. *Apply* the framework of causal thinking against a series of studies to determine whether the study has achieved the goal that it intends. 

## Class Introductions 



## Article Discussion 

### Predict or Cause 

- What are a few examples that Athey raises of causal questions masquerading as prediction questions? 
  1.  
  2. 
  3. 
- Which of these examples is the most surprising to you? 
- Is there something that is common to each of these examples? Is this a general phenomenon, or is Athey very clever in picking examples? Said differently, is Athey making a clever argument or is a lot of what we do as data scientists actually causal work in disguise? 

### Do the suburbs make you fat? 

1. What is the causal claim being made in this article? 
2. If you had to draw out this causal claim, using arrows, what would it look like? 
3. Do you acknowledge the association that the authors present? Is there *actually* a difference between the BMI of people who live in cities and the suburbs? 
4. If you acknowledge the association, does that compel you to believe the causal claim? Why or why not?
5. Name, and draw, five alternative *confounding* variables that might make you skeptical that the claimed relationship exists. 
6. (Optional) Name, and draw two *mechanisms* that might exist between suburbs and BMI. Why does the existence (or not) of these mechanisms *not* pose a fundamental problem to the causal claim that the authors make? 
7. At the conclusion of reading this paper, do you believe that there is a causal relationship between location and BMI? If so, what compels you to to believe this; if not, why are you not compelled to believe this? 

### Nike Shoes 

1. What is the causal claim being made in this article? 
2. If you had to draw out this causal  claim, using arrows, what would it look like? 
3. Do you acknowledge the association that the authors present? Is there actually a difference in the finish time between people who are running with the Nike shoes vs. other shoes? 
4.  If you acknowledge the association, does that compel you to believe the causal claim? Why or why not? 
5. What are some of the confounding relationships that the authors identify? (Can you name four?) How do they adjust their analyses once they acknowledge the confounding problem? 
6. At the conclusion of reading this paper, do you believe that there is a causal relationship between shoes and finish time? If so, what compels you to to believe this; if not, why are you not compelled to believe this? 

### What is Science: Feynman's View

In *Cargo Cult Science*, Richard Feynman poses a view of science that is about a seeking of the truth. 

1. What is Feynman's view of science? What does he think makes something *scientific*? 
2. What are ways that individuals fool themselves when they are working as scientists? What are ways that individuals fool themselves when they are working as data scientists? 
3. How can we as (data) scientists, train ourselves not to be fooled?^[This is a footnote, rendered into an html document.]
